    """Use this mixin to overwrite __getitem__ to return data and its transformed copy.

    This mixin overwrites __getitem__ to return a piece of data, and a transformed copy
    of this piece of data.

    In the init it defines the ways in which the data will be transformed, and calls
    super to instantiate the parent class. There is no parent class unless this class
    is used in the context of a mixin, so it will not work on its own.

    Example::

        class ModelNet40OnlineOptimization(OnlineOptimizationDatasetMixin, ModelNet40):
            pass

    Note:
        The order of classes in the mixin defined in the above example matters!
        OnlineOptimizationDataset must come first, as its __init__method calls
        super and instantiates ModelNet40.

    generated at inference time is referred to as the path. These will be saved and
