class ThresholdedGaussian2DLocationModule():
    """
    a model of a grid cell module. the module has one or more Gaussian activity bumps
    that move as the population receives motor input. when two bumps are near each
    other, the intermediate cells have higher firing rates than they would with a single
    bump. the cells with firing rates above a certain threshold are considered "active".

    doesn't model path integration. when the network receives a motor command, it shifts
    its bump. we track each bump as floating point coordinates and we shift the bumps
    with movement.
    this model isn't attempting to explain how path integration works.
    it's attempting to show how a population of cells that can path integrate are useful
    in a larger network.

    cells are distributed uniformly through the rhombus -- packed in the optimal
    hexagonal arrangement. during learning, the cell nearest to the current phase
    is associated with the sensed feature.

    cells_per_axis, active_firing_rate, and bump_sigma all must be chosen such that:
      - one cell fires at each location
      - inference accounts for uncertainty in the learned locations (must use a large
        enough set of active cells)

    path integration works *somehow*. this model doesn't attempt to propose how
    "path integration" works. it rather shows how locations are anchored to sensory
    cues.

    the model receives a "delta location" vector and
    shifts the active cells accordingly. the model stores intermediate coordinates of
    active cells. whenever sensory cues activate a cell, the model adds this cell to
    the list of coordinates being shifted.

    orientation is specified in a counter-clockwise manner:
    when orientation is 0 degrees, displacement is [di, dj]: move di cells "down" and
    dj cells "right".
    when orientation is 90 degrees, the model is equivalent to a Cartesian system
    with the origin on the bottom left. displacement here is [dx, dy].

    usage:
        - whenever the sensor moves, call movement_compute()
        - whenever the sensor senses something, call sensory_compute()

    `anchor_input` is a feature-location pair SDR.

    specify how points are tracked via `anchoring_method`:
        - "corners": designed for noise-tolerance. will activate all cells that are
                     possible outcomes of path integration
