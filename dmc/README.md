# Demonstrating Monty Capabilities Experiments

This repository contains the code for the experiments in the paper "Demonstrating Monty Capabilities".

## Running the Experiments

Configs to train models and run experiments are in the `configs` directory.

## Reproducting Figures from the Paper

Analaysis scripts to generate the figures are in the `scripts` directory. The data for figures can either be generated via `configs`, or you can directly download the pre-trained models at `link-to-be-confirmed` and the raw results from experiments at `link-to-be-confirmed`.
