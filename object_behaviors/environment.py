        a particular interaction type between the two connected objects (sampled at
        the beginning of each simulation). One end of the chain is fixed, while the
        other end is freely moving and can be influenced by agent-generated actions
        (3D forces). Note that the current environment implementation does not
        allow for defining interaction loops (where one node may connect to more than
        two other nodes). Interactions are defined as separate classes in the the
        interactions.py module which gives flexibility to define novel interaction

        are differential equations defined on the set of all dynamical variables that,
        together, fully-determine the state of the system at any point in time.

        In practice, dynamical variables are introduced for each sampled interaction.
        For a planar rotational joint the relevant dynamical variable would be the angle
        of the joint and its angular velocity, while for a linear joint or spring it
        would be the displacement in the linear direction of the joint and its linear
        velocity. Note that those dynamical variables always come in pair, which we will
        refer to as "r" and "v" to be consistent with most online sympy examples. "r" is
        the variable that defines the current state of the joint at time t (e.g. angle
        of a planar rotational joint), while "v" is its time derivative (e.g. angular
        velocity). For joints with more than one degree of freedom (e.g. spherical
        joint), there will be one "r" and one "v" per DOF. The .get_dynamic_variables()
        method of that interaction type should then output the list of all "r" variables
        and "v" variables for r_i and v_i respectively.

        Both variables need to be solved for (through the EOMs) in order to simulate
        the dynamics of the system. Once determined, they can be mapped to the absolute
        3D coordinates, pose vectors, velocities, etc... of each object part.

        keeps track of the current state of the dynamical variables and uses it at every
